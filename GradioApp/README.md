Here will explain the instructions for running the model. The model is executed through a web-based interface supported by Gradio.
Please note that we donâ€™t need to run all the models, only a few of them as listed below:

- ```maxim_fasttext.vec```
- ```label_encoder.pkl```
- ```maxim-sentiment-models.onnx```

Make sure you have already [downloaded](https://huggingface.co/Nuvantim/maxim_sentiment_analysis_model/tree/main) it, or you can build the model yourself.
In any case, all models must be stored in the ```models``` folder.
